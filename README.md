# My First GitHub project.
INTRODUCTION-
The Great Hartland Community Library, run by a dedicated team of volunteers, serves a close-knit community by providing access to a diverse collection of books. They use a manual system, which is inefficient and prone to errors. 

The library seeks a digital solution to streamline operations and improve service quality for its patrons. Eventually, Great Hartland Community Library would like to implement a computer-based system for keeping records of their books, checking out and checking books, performing searches, and other functionality for managing the library.
